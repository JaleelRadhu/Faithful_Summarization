    "Actual": "Hypothyroidism, characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones, can lead to weight gain and fatigue due to a slowed metabolism. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes crucial to prevent weight gain and associated complications. The assertion that you don't need to diet to lose weight suggests the importance of focusing on nutrient-dense foods rather than restricting calories excessively. Achieving the minimum nutrient requirements necessitates consuming around 5000 calories a day from the right sources, which is impractical in today's food environment. The statement also emphasizes that dieters, often characterized by poor eating habits and meal skipping, might struggle to meet their nutritional needs. Depending on factors like height and weight, the average woman requires around 100 grams of lean protein daily, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and at least one gallon of water to support overall health.",

    "question": "What is the best cure for endometriosis?",
    "perspective": "INFORMATION",
    "answers": [
      "There is no cure for endometriosis. But there are many treatments, each of which has pros and cons. It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. \n\nPain Medication \n\nFor some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. \n\nHormone Treatment \n\nFor patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). \n\nBirth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. \n\nDanocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other \"barrier\" methods to prevent pregnancy. \n\nGnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well.

Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw",

Be careful with Lupron Depot it lowers your hormones which can cause bone problems.\n\nYou can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back.

      "According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, \n\"[h]ysterectomy is often indicated in the presence of severe symptoms with failure of other treatments and when fertility is no longer desired.\"\n\nFor me, hysterectomy was a good option for controlling the pain of endometriosis, but it was only AFTER I had tried other treatments, such as Depo-Provera, Depo-Lupron, oral contraceptives (birth control pills, three laparoscopies with laser cautery to the endometriosis, pain medication, alternative treamtments including TENS, acupuncture, acupressure, chiropractic, and massage therapy.  \n\nThe BEST decision is the one that is best for the individual, and is decided between her and her doctor.",
      "First let me start off by saying that PREGNANCY DOES NOT CURE ENDO FOR ALL WOMEN, in fact for some women, their endo comes back after getting pregnant and others are not ready to get pregnant. I was diagnosed with endometriosis back when i was 13, and believe me, i wish there was a magical cure. I did a Distinguished Achievement Program project on endo in high school last year and researched various treatments. So far, the treatment that i have found works best for many women are using alternative treatments such as nutritional approaches. Many women have found relief by eating better such as ORGANIC FOODS, HERBAL REMEDIES, and lots of stress reducing exercise, such as yoga, meditation or even just running. The best thing to do is to research as much as you can. That is what helped me the most. It made me feel more in control of my endo. Different treatments work diversely for different women, work with your doctor and your own research to find out what works best for you, whether it be by medical, surgical, or alternative treatments. GOOD LUCK !!!"
