INFORMATION, the right kinds of foods to lose weight.</s>,"Hypothyroidism, characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones, can lead to weight gain and fatigue due to a slowed metabolism. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes crucial to prevent weight gain and associated complications. The assertion that you don't need to diet to lose weight suggests the importance of focusing on nutrient-dense foods rather than restricting calories excessively. Achieving the minimum nutrient requirements necessitates consuming around 5000 calories a day from the right sources, which is impractical in today's food environment. The statement also emphasizes that dieters, often characterized by poor eating habits and meal skipping, might struggle to meet their nutritional needs. Depending on factors like height and weight, the average woman requires around 100 grams of lean protein daily, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and at least one gallon of water to support overall health.","['it sounds alot like hypothyroidism which meens that your body is not producing enough thyroid hormones. this can cause you to gain weight and lack energy.\n\nalso sounds like possible depression so see a doctor.', 'You need to do more in order for you to lose the weight although you say you are active.Your metabolism slows as we age and you need to keep your metabolism going or you will be gaining weight and at risk for complications or dieases.\nWhen you are at home at night, walk for 30 minutes before you sit down to eat.', '?', ""First, congratulations and welcome to the other side.\n\nSecond, you don't need to diet to loose weight.

INFORMATION,<pad> Chronic endometriosis is the most common cause of endometriosis.</s>,"Endometriosis has no cure, but there are various treatments, each with its own pros and cons. Building a strong doctor-patient relationship is essential for deciding the most suitable option. Pain medication may be sufficient for those with mild symptoms, while women with minimal endometriosis aspiring to become pregnant might opt for a trial period of unprotected sex. Hormone treatments, including birth control pills, progestin, Danocrine, or GnRH agonists, are suggested for those not aiming for pregnancy, but their effectiveness varies. Surgery, such as laparoscopy, is recommended for extensive or severe cases. Hysterectomy may be considered in severe cases when other treatments fail and fertility is no longer desired. The choice of treatment is highly individual, necessitating collaborative decision-making between the patient and her doctor, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to note that pregnancy does not universally cure endometriosis, and various treatments should be explored based on individual circumstances and preferences.","['There is no cure for endometriosis. But there are many treatments, each of which has pros and cons. It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. \n\nPain Medication \n\nFor some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. \n\nHormone Treatment \n\nFor patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). \n\nBirth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can\'t take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. \n\nDanocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other ""barrier"" methods to prevent pregnancy. \n\nGnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well.

Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other ""barrier"" methods to prevent pregnancy. \n\nGnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw', ""Pregnancy. However, it's hard to get pregnant when you have endometriosis. Be careful with Lupron Depot it lowers your hormones which can cause bone problems.\n\nYou can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back. See a Reproductive Endocrinologist and try to get pregnant. If you wait too long for pregnancy it may not happen.\n\nStay hopeful and prayerful."", 'According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, \n""[h]ysterectomy is often indicated in the presence of severe symptoms with failure of other treatments and when fertility is no longer desired.""\n\nFor me, hysterectomy was a good option for controlling the pain of endometriosis, but it was only AFTER I had tried other treatments, such as Depo-Provera, Depo-Lupron, oral contraceptives (birth control pills, three laparoscopies with laser cautery to the endometriosis, pain medication, alternative treamtments including TENS, acupuncture, acupressure, chiropractic, and massage therapy.  \n\nThe BEST decision is the one that is best for the individual, and is decided between her and her doctor.', 'First let me start off by saying that PREGNANCY DOES NOT CURE ENDO FOR ALL WOMEN, in fact for some women, their endo comes back after getting pregnant and others are not ready to get pregnant.

I did a Distinguished Achievement Program project on endo in high school last year and researched various treatments. So far, the treatment that i have found works best for many women are using alternative treatments such as nutritional approaches. Many women have found relief by eating better such as ORGANIC FOODS, HERBAL REMEDIES, and lots of stress reducing exercise, such as yoga, meditation or even just running. The best thing to do is to research as much as you can. That is what helped me the most. It made me feel more in control of my endo.

Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have ""innocent"" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart. Thorough examination and appropriate tests help determine the cause of the heart murmur, and treatment may involve medication, surgery, or precautions against infections.

Aim for at least 30 minutes of cardio four to three times a week, coupled with core workouts. Starting with activities like brisk walking is efficient, easy on the knees, and accessible anywhere. Various programs, including pilates and core DVDs, are available on platforms like Amazon and Collage Video, where you can preview DVDs to find a suitable beginner-level program. Avoid advanced DVDs, as it's important to choose a routine that is manageable for you. Cardio exercises help burn fat covering the abs, contributing to a more sculpted appearance. Pay attention to your diet, incorporating whole grains, fruits, and vegetables while minimizing simple carbs like chips or candy. Following the food pyramid and exercising regularly forms the foundation for a healthy lifestyle. Achieving fitness goals is a long-term commitment, not a short-term fix. Prioritize a balanced diet and regular exercise, making it a lifestyle choice rather than a temporary solution.

INFORMATION,<pad> Oxygen Dissociation Curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen.</s>,"The oxygen dissociation curve illustrates how hemoglobin in our blood binds and releases oxygen in response to varying oxygen levels. A key indicator, the P50 value, signifies the pressure at which half the red blood cells are saturated with oxygen. In the lungs, where oxygen levels are high, hemoglobin forms oxyhemoglobin. During circulation to oxygen-deprived tissues, the curve shows how oxyhemoglobin releases oxygen. The curve's sigmoid shape results from cooperative binding, enhancing oxygen affinity. Factors influencing binding include temperature, pH (Bohr Shift), and organic phosphates like 2,3-DPG, which decrease oxygen affinity, causing the curve to shift to the right. Understanding this curve is crucial for comprehending how our blood effectively carries and releases oxygen.","['The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen.  Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50  value.  This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen.  (Bouverot, 1985).  The purpose of an oxygen dissociation curve is to show the equilibrium of oxyhemoglobin and nonbonded hemoglobin at various partial pressures (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  At high partial pressures of oxygen, usually in the lungs, hemoglobin binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin.  When the blood is fully saturated all the erythrocytes are in the form of oxyhemoglobin.  As the erythrocytes travel to tissues deprived of oxygen the partial pressure of oxygen will decrease.  Consequently, the oxyhemoglobin releases the oxygen to form hemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  \n\nThe sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve is a result of the cooperative binding of oxygen to the four polypeptide chains.  Cooperative binding is the characteristic of a hemoglobin to have a greater ability to bind oxygen after a subunit has bound oxygen (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  Thus, hemoglobin is most attracted to oxygen when three of the four polypeptide chains are bound to oxygen.  \n\n \n\nFactors that Influence Oxygen Binding\n\n    *\n\n      Temperature- Increasing the temperature denatures the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin, which increases the amount of oxygen and hemoglobin and decreases the concentration of oxyhemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      pH- A decrease in pH (increase in acidity) by addition of carbon dioxide or other acids causes a Bohr Shift.

The curve shifts to the right.', 'The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen.
