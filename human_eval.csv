Answer 4: I had it and my first reaction to the illness was a violent headache, the second was stimulus sensitivity, third was body pain then vomiting due to the power of the pain. 

The emergency room docs didn't know what was wrong so they called in a Neurologyst. His first test was to tell me to put my chin to my chest. NO WAY! It almost made me black out with pain. They immediately did a spinal tap and found the viral meningitis. It took from 4pm to 2am for the illness to send me to the hospital, it took from 2:30 am to 11:30 am to diagnos.

I almost died several times in the next three days. I don't remember anything but the constant drip of morphine into my blood. I was in the hospital for 21 days and in bed at home for another 10. 

I wouldn't wish this illness on anyone...no matter how horrid they are.

8,How do I stop racing thoughts a night when I try to sleep?,"Answer 1: Sleeping medication of any kind is very habit forming.  Hope you did not just stop taking sleeping pills all at once.  (If you did you may have made your condition alot worse).  Like any habit forming drug you need to wean yourself off under the care of a doctor.  

Your mind is racing like a computer when you are trying to sleep. Your problem sounds somewhat complex, being the length of time you have experienced an inability to get atleast a good eight hours of sleep without your mind running like a computer. 
 
Many people don't know how to leave their work at their job and bring the work home with them and take the work to bed with them.  And there can be serious underling problems that may be a serious mental problem or problems.   

Suggest you find a real good psychiatrist who will listen and give you a good psych. assessment and not put you on more medications if it is just a problem of stress.  (Valium is good for a short period of time only if you have severe anxiety problems).

Once you are stable, get yourself into a stress management group.

I could say that you should wipe every thought out of your mind when you lay down in your bed. This is easier said then done. (Something I taught myself from childhood).

Wish you all the best.

Answer 5: see a doctor and get yourself to be able to sleep...the doctor can help you

good luck

9,wht causes ovarian cysts in the body? Any prevention?,"Answer 1: Ovarian cysts form for numerous reasons. The most common type is a follicular cyst, which results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the normal fluid-filled sac that contains an egg. Follicular cysts form when the follicle grows larger than normal during the menstrual cycle and does not open to release the egg. Usually, follicular cysts resolve on their own over the course of days to months. Cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic or endometrioid cysts) from injury or leakage of tiny blood vessels into the egg sac. If a woman is in her 40's, or younger, and has regular menstrual periods, most ovarian masses are ""functioning ovarian cysts,"" which are not really abnormal. They are related to the process of ovulation that happens with the menstrual cycle. They usually disappear on their own during a future menstrual cycle. Therefore, especially in women in their 20's and 30's, these cysts are watched for a few menstrual cycles to verify that they disappear. Because oral contraceptives work in part by preventing ovulation, physicians will not really expect women who are taking oral contraceptives to have common ""functioning ovarian cysts."" Thus, women who develop ovarian cysts while taking oral contraceptives may be advised against simple observation; rather, they may receive closer monitoring with pelvic ultrasound or, less commonly, surgical exploration of the ovary. Functional ovarian cysts cannot be prevented if you are ovulating. Anything that makes ovulation less frequent reduces your chance of developing an ovarian cyst. Birth control pills, pregnancy, and breast-feeding in the first 6 months following birth prevent ovulation. Ovulation ceases when menopause is complete. Women who use high-dose birth control pills have a modestly decreased risk of developing functional ovarian cysts; low-dose birth control pills seem to have a less preventive effect.

Answer 3: Fexofenadine is an oral, ""second generation"" antihistamine that is used to treat the signs and symptoms of allergy that are due to histamine. It is similar to the other second generation antihistamines loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and azelastine (Astelin). Histamine is a chemical that is responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, for example, swelling of the lining of the nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and then attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. The attachment of the histamine to the receptors causes the cell to be ""activated,"" releasing other chemicals that produce the effects that we associate with allergy, e.g., sneezing. Fexofenadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of H1 receptor-containing cells by histamine. Unlike the first generation antihistamines, fexofenadine and other second-generation antihistamines do not readily enter the brain from the blood, and, therefore, they cause less drowsiness.

Generally speaking, however, they probably will be a period of brain chemistry adjustment.  The same could be said for alcohol and other non-prescription drugs and even some foods.

Answer 2: absolutely you will have withdrawals.  I've been taking them for about 30 years and it is now life-threatening for me to stop.  Get off of them as soon as possible if your doctor says it's ok for you to do so.

It didn't happen right away, but then the medicine doesn't get out of your system right away either. That's just what happened ot me, you may be ready to get off them and have no side effect whatsoever. Everyone's withdrawl is different, I'd advise talking to your doctor about it.

23,can u guys help me to loose wait in a healthy way thank u?,"Answer 1: Yes!  COOK COOK COOK all your meals! with healthy food and the time it takes u to make them you will loose the hunger and obsession on food. Also, never skipp a meal, you will only get more anxious aftewards and overeat, BUT eat less portions. If you feel hungry between meals drink ORANGE Juice & pineapple: pinneapple burns fat!. get use to drink lots of water and RUN! start running EVERY day some minutes and you will see how you losse immediately. No sweets, no chocolate, no fast food of any sort! COOK healthy things, eat everything healthy but less. you will feel better each day! good luck.

Answer 2: Hi there.  First - patience is key - there is no quick fix.  Second - wise choices are key.  You have to think of your weight loss as a lifelong committment.  It doesn't have to be a life of torture and deprivation, though.  Depending on how much structure you need, a program like Weight Watchers may be beneficial.  I tend to stay away from fruit juices because they are loaded with calories and they dump sugar in you.  Eating the whole fruit is better for you - you get the nutrients plus fiber.  Portion control is key.  But, you also shouldn't deprive yourself of everything you like.  For example, you can allow yourself a small treat (for example, a tablespoon of chocolate syrup in milk) everyday, and a larger treat once a week without sabotaging your efforts.  

Very important: exercise.  If you haven't been exercising much, start small, like walking.  But keep it up and increase your activity level steadily.  A combination of weight training and aerobics really works.  You don't have to invest in a gym membership.  Go our for a walk, run, or bike ride.  Get a series of workout dvds (I recommend The Firm series).","span1: COOK COOK COOK all your meals! with healthy food and the time it takes u to make them you will loose the hunger and obsession on food.
