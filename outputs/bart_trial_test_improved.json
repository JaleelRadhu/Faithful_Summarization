Building a strong doctor-patient relationship is essential for deciding the most suitable option. Pain medication may be sufficient for those with mild symptoms, while women with minimal endometriosis aspiring to become pregnant might opt for a trial period of unprotected sex. Hormone treatments, including birth control pills, progestin, Danocrine, or GnRH agonists, are suggested for those not aiming for pregnancy, but their effectiveness varies. Surgery, such as laparoscopy, is recommended for extensive or severe cases. Hysterectomy may be considered in severe cases when other treatments fail and fertility is no longer desired. The choice of treatment is highly individual, necessitating collaborative decision-making between the patient and her doctor, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
