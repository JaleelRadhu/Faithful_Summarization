As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes crucial to prevent weight gain and associated complications.

Notably, dyslexia can exist even in those who read and write proficiently. Neurophysiologically, dyslexia can be identified through the examination of brain morphology, often posthumously.

    "Gold Summary": "You personally received a diagnosis of a heart murmur a few years ago, but when checked by a cardiologist, it was deemed not concerning. Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have \"innocent\" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart. Thorough examination and appropriate tests help determine the cause of the heart murmur, and treatment may involve medication, surgery, or precautions against infections. The sound of a heart murmur is distinct from normal heart sounds and is audible through a stethoscope.",

    "Gold Summary": "Breathing exclusively through the nose is the typical and natural way of breathing. Most people don't consciously pay attention to their breathing due to its involuntary nature. However, focusing on how you breathe can potentially increase anxiety and hinder the ability to fall asleep quickly. Nose breathing accumulates more heat in the body, while breathing through the mouth dissipates heat. There are various benefits associated with nose breathing, as outlined in a provided source. While individual variations exist, overall metabolism is influenced by factors such as breathing, muscular activity, and heart rate. The example of Neanderthals having larger, more open noses illustrates how breathing patterns can adapt to specific needs, such as rapid breathing for heat conservation. In summary, breathing through the nose is generally considered normal, and there is no need for concern about potential issues.",
