# 📝 Perspective-Aware Summary Evaluation Prompt  

You will be given:  
- A **perspective-aware summary** (focused on a specific perspective of a healthcare issue).  
- The **intended perspective** and its definition.  
- **Input spans** captured from the answers.  
- The **original answers** for comparison.  

Your task: **Evaluate the summary** using four metrics.  
For each metric, provide:  
1. **Reasoning** (short but clear explanation)  
2. **Numeric Score** (1–5, based on the scale)  

⚠️ Follow the evaluation criteria exactly. Do **not** skip or change the template.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria  

### 1. Extraneous Information (1–5)  
Measures hallucinations or unsupported content.  
- **5** – No extraneous information, fully supported.  
- **4** – Minimal extraneous info, mostly aligned.  
- **3** – Moderate extraneous info, somewhat aligned.  
- **2** – Significant extraneous info, poorly aligned.  
- **1** – Mostly or entirely extraneous, not supported.  

---

### 2. Contradiction (1–5)  
Checks for direct contradictions with the answers.  
- **5** – No contradictions at all.  
- **4** – Minor contradictions.  
- **3** – Some noticeable contradictions.  
- **2** – Major contradictions.  
- **1** – Completely inconsistent with answers.  

---

### 3. Perspective Misalignment (1–5)  
Evaluates whether the summary deviates from the intended perspective.  
- **5** – Fully aligned with the given perspective.  
- **4** – Mostly aligned, small deviations.  
- **3** – Balanced between correct and different perspectives.  
- **2** – Primarily presents a different perspective.  
- **1** – Completely different perspective, misaligned.  

---

### 4. Redundancy (1–5)  
Measures unnecessary repetition of information.  
- **5** – No redundancy, concise and clear.  
- **4** – Slight redundancy, does not harm clarity.  
- **3** – Moderate redundancy, some repetition.  
- **2** – High redundancy, frequent repetition.  
- **1** – Extremely redundant, overwhelming repetition.  

---

## 🧾 Evaluation Steps  

1. Review the **summary** carefully.  
2. Compare it with the **input spans** and **answers**.  
3. Check for extraneous information, contradictions, perspective misalignment, and redundancy.  
4. Write short reasoning for each metric.  
5. Give a **numeric score (1–5)** for each metric.
