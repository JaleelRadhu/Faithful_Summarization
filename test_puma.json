            "Pins and needles\n \n  \n\n'Pins and needles' (paraesthesia) is a sensation of uncomfortable tingling or prickling, usually felt in the hands or feet. The affected area is sometimes said to have 'fallen asleep'. A common cause is leaning or lying awkwardly on a limb, which either presses against the nerves or reduces the blood supply to the local area. Changing position quickly restores normal feeling. Any numbness is soon replaced by the tingling and prickling sensation, as the nerves start sending messages again to the brain and spinal cord. In some cases, pins and needles are caused by nerve damage or certain disorders of the central nervous system. Always see your doctor if you experience frequent or persistent bouts of pins and needles.\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of pins and needles include:\n\n    * Hands and feet are usually affected\n    * Initial numbness and heaviness\n    * Prickling and tingling sensation on the skin\n    * Return of normal feeling a few minutes after changing position.\n\nA range of causes\nPins and needles can be caused by a wide range of events and conditions, including:\n\n    * Pressure on nerves\n    * Reduced blood supply\n    * Nerve injury\n    * Hyperventilation or breathing excessively\n    * The effect of toxic substances on the nerves, such as alcohol or lead\n    * Certain medications\n    * Diabetes\n    * Multiple sclerosis\n    * Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland)\n    * Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)\n    * Stroke.",

Common allergy causing agents are household detergents or factors linked to your occupation. \n\n\nIt is very unlikely that the itching is related to your circulation. There are other conditions that give rise to itching but the itch tends to be more generalised all over the body. You will need to visit your GP so he or she can assess your hands and advise you on the likely cause and treatment. If you are worried about anything in particular, it is very important that you tell you're doctor.",
